# Yeseva One

#### Open-source font by Jovanny Lemonad

A serif display type that is very feminine. I think that this is the only type in the world with such a feminine essence. Yeseva's name is from the phrase "Yes, Eva." As a sign of complete agreement between a man and a woman. I dedicate this font to my beloved wife.

Yeseva's design was updated in September 2012, and version 2.0 is 5 percent narrower. I added a lot of new characters and refined many of the existing ones.

Updated: January 2016 with a technical fix to the non-breaking-space character.
